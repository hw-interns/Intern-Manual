# Scheduling & Related Policies & Expectations Contract

This contract is an acknowledgment of the Department of Health & Wellness policies and expectations as an intern. These guidelines help with the smooth and efficient operation of our department. For HP interns, Advocate Coords, HAWC Coords, and FNBS interns, 1/3 of hrs \(max\) should be used for prep & meetings. Most of the work should be in implementing programming. Interns should discuss this balance regularly with their advisors. Marketing will be scheduled for tabling when needed.  All work must be completed in the H&W office.

**H&W VALUE**

Self-care in important. School is important. UCSB students deserve consistent, quality programs and services from H&W. We promote a culture of thoughtful & realistic scheduling so that interns have the time and energy to take care of themselves and get their job done for H&W. This is a job and should be viewed as such. Pro Staff will do our best to accommodate school related absences. Help us help you by planning ahead and providing at least 2 weeksâ€™ notice.

**DEAD WEEK, FINALS WEEK & QUARTER BREAKS**

* Interns are not required to work dead week or finals week, however, all projects must be completed before interns leave for break. Hours are available if interns are interested during dead week or finals week.
* Interns are not budgeted to work over break. Exceptions may be granted on a case by case basis. 

**SCHEDULING POLICY**

H&W uses When2Work scheduling software.

* All interns must input academic schedules into When2Work quarterly and keep updated.
* Schedule should only be blocked for class and other pre-approved commitments \(see Jo\)
* Ideally, 1/3 of hrs \(max\) should be used for prep & meetings, 2/3 hrs executing H&W programming
* Each team needs to balance planning and execution of H&W programming \(each intern needs to have space in their schedules to staff programming\)

1. **Big events** \(all hands on deck\)
   1. Ideally, a HP team member is **chair** and is available for most of the event. Team members would ideally be **shift leaders**.
   2. ICs will fill in the additional spots with available interns from other teams and advocates.
2. **Recurring Shifts** \(WTF, Meditation, ect.\)

   1. Ideally, a HP team member is shifted for recurring shifts.
   2. ICs will fill in the additional spots with available interns from other teams and advocates.
   3. If you are assigned a recurring shift, you should be prepared to work that shift weeks 2-9 unless otherwise noted.

   **Pop up events** \(workshops, tabling, etc.\)

   1. ICs assign first based on intern training, and then on availability.
