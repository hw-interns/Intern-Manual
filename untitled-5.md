# Scheduling Events Protocol

Scheduling Events Protocol \(Draft\) as we transition to w2w  
Guiding Principles: • We do not own their lives • They can block out time to best suit their wellness, as long as they have enough time to offer H&W. We do our best to honor the “prefer not to work” function on w2w • When we send around sign-ups we do not send around more than 2x. No pressure. If we can’t get something filled, staff will have to step up. • We will try not to shift in less than 1 hour blocks. • We will try to schedule interns more than 1-2 shifts per day.

1. Big \(one time\) events a. HP team member should be assigned to be CHAIR. b. Chair & Advisor modify Goo Cal Template and add to Goo Cal Event that should already exist from Master Planner Spreadsheet \(including chair, shift leader, intern, and advocate shifts needed\). c. Ideally, chair is available for most of the event and chair availability is included in the Goo Cal Event as a SHIFT LEADER d. Ideally, team members would be shift leaders and their availability is included in the Goo Cal Event e. ICs transfer shifts to w2w and fill in additional spots with available interns from other teams. f. ICs work with ACs to shift advocates \(see Protocol XXX\). g. Advisor should be present especially for set-up and clean-up
2. Pop up events \(workshops, tabling, etc.\) a. Pop-up events need a minimum of 3 weeks to be able to schedule interns b. CHAIR/ADVISOR: add event to Master Planner Spreadsheet & Goo Cal and email to • ICs \(to schedule\) • Data Management \(to add event ID\) • Marketing \(just to let them know to check the master planner\) c. ICs assign first based on intern trainings, and then on availability.
3. Pop up events with less than 3 weeks’ notice can still be attempted, but sign-ups will be voluntary \(passed around during Thursday night meetings\). ICs will not shift interns with less than 2 weeks’ notice. a. GroupMe requests are reserved for Director Approved Pop-Ups \(divisional priorities\)
4. Repeating Shifts \(WTF, Meditation, ect.\) a. Advisors/Chair: Add needs to Goo Cal b. ICs: assign interns based first on team affiliation, then availability.
5. Intern Shift How to Call in Sick
