# Staffing for Intern Meetings

Sharleen 1x per month

Team meetings start right at 5:30

All Intern meeting starts right at 6:30 \(Classroom 1\)

Start with 3 deep breaths

ICs didn't like spotlight.

I didn't ask about funny videos

1. Why should pro staff attend intern meeting?
   1. For interns to see group cohesion
   2. For advisors to have a sense of what is happening/being asked of interns
   3. For advisors to provide input and facilitate team needs
2. How many staff should attend each week?
   1. With a full staff, 6 advisors to more than necessary
   2. I recommend 1 permanent staff \(Joanna\) and 2 additional staff rotate
   3. Julian has requested to be permanent staff as well. This could change if his schedule changes
3. Expectations of scheduled staff:
   1. Stay with the group, stay engaged, and contribute as appropriate.
   2. Be on time/start team meetings on time
   3. End team meetings @ 6:25 to regroup and be ready to start ALL Intern meeting on time
   4. Keep staff and interns accountable.
   5. Help set-up & clean up.
   6. Check in with ICs prior to leaving to be sure all tasks are completed.
