# Cancelling/Changing Events Protocol

Before you cancel/change an event consider:

1. Only **Pro-Staff** can authorize cancelling an event.
2. The impact to UCSB students. Is there another way?
3. Marketing
   1. Do we have time to inform potential audience members of the change?
   2. If print marketing \(flyers\) have already gone out how will we let our partners know it has been canceled?
   3. How will we get cancellation signage to the event location?
4. Scheduling…How does this impact:
   1. Pro Staff
   2. Interns
   3. Advocates

**To successfully cancel an event:**

More than a week in advance notice:

One week or less notice:

Less than 24 hours’ notice:

1. **ADVISOR:** Go to **MASTER PLANNER**
   1. Write “CANCELLED” in front of the event title
   2.  Fill the row in red \(no green\)
   3. **ADVISOR** drafts one email with specific requests to:
      1. ICs \(to schedule\)
         1. When2Work \(Interns\)
         2. UCSB Health & Wellness Internships Google Calendar \(Advocates\)
            1. Send Goo Update and ???
      2. Data Management \(to mark as cancelled\)
      3. Marketing \(let them know to check the master planner\)
   4. **ADVISOR** texts interns to let them know it’s cancelled.
   5. If event is cancelled day of, **Advisor** is responsible the above actions in cases where the usual intern/staff are not available

**To successfully change any detail of an event:**

1. **ADVISOR:** Go to **MASTER PLANNER**
   1. Make applicable changes to the Master Planner Spreadsheet
   2.  Highlight changes in yellow \(?\)
   3. **ADVISOR** drafts one email with specific requests to:
      1. ICs \(scheduling changes\)
         1. When2Work \(Interns\)
         2. UCSB Health & Wellness Internships Google Calendar \(Advocates\)
      2. Data Management \(not sure what changes he would care about\)
      3. Marketing \(let them know to check the master planner\)
   4. **ADVISOR** texts interns to let them know of changes \(especially last minute\).

**Rain Plan:**

1. Rain plans should be made for all events/services impacted by bad weather.
2. For example, the MPR is reserved as a rain location for DTD, due to the complexity of dog owners coming from out of town
3. Outdoor Meditation should have an alternate rain location.
4. It might be decided at the time of planning that an outdoor tabling will be cancelled in the event of rain.
5. All events with alt rain location should have signage up in original location.
6. Any event without a rain plan should be marketing as “cancelled in the event of rain”

**UCSB Health & Wellness Internships Google Calendar** \(referred to as the “Goo Cal”\)

Interns should be able to make up hours missed due to cancelled events. If interns need additional hours, they should repot to their advisor for additional projects/assignments.
