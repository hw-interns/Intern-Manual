# Roles & Responsibilities

Chair, Shift Leader & Advocate

_**Chair**_

The chair of an event is the intern in charge of planning, organizing and implementing the event from start to finish. Along with their advisor, they are responsible to:

* Create/follow pre-existing outlines needed to successfully implement the event
  * Any preexisting outlines should be located on the J drive, asana, box \(phasing out\) or in a physical binder \(above computers in Peer Room\)
* Double check event details are accurate on the **Master Planner Spreadsheet** \(for marketing and other purposes\)
* Inventory and organize supplies & educational materials \(well in advance\)
* Delegate tasks to team members \(shared responsibility and involvement\)
  * It takes a lot to put on an event and can feel pretty overwhelming when you are alone. Be smart about your time and wellbeing by incorporating the other members of your team.
* Request and/or confirm location
* Ensure the event is compliant with safety and health regulations
  * i.e. food safety, room capacity, etc.
* Create a template of the staffing \(at least 3 weeks in advance\) needs of the event \(see Scheduling Events Protocol\). It may also be helpful to look at similar Goo Cal events from previous quarters to see what was needed.
* Connect \(by email or in person\) with all shift leaders to be sure they understand their roles and responsibilities
* Request time in ALL Intern Meeting to disseminate
  * **logistical information** \(how the event will function\) Ex. Explaining floorplan and station set-up for the event
  * **Health content information**: Health information and resources that interns should know Ex. Continuing education on sexually transmitted infections for Gaucho HIV Testing
* Create Surveys with your advisor \(identify desired questions to include on the survey and print out surveys
* Communicate with MARKETING \(?\) to have adequate number of flyers and other paper materials printed and cut 1 week in advance of event
* Make sure advocate name tags have been printed and ample volunteer t-shirts are packed
* Reserve Transportation Equipment on Goo Cals: Grey Cart/Dolly/Blue Wagon/EVE Electric Cart. Communicate/Coordinate with others as needed
* Consider if Student Health open/close time will affect the event and plan ahead
* Finalize data \(surveys and report sheet\) and send to the data management intern
* Gather feedback, debrief event and modify outline so that the next iteration is better!!! \(use asana, j-drive or physical binder\)

_**Shift Leader**_

The shift leader is in charge during a specific shift of the event. They are expected to be a leader, know what needs to happen, and keep the event running smoothly. They are responsible to:

* Check in with Chair to make sure they understand their roles and responsibilities
* Make sure everyone working at that time has a H&W shirt and a name tag
  * Advocates need name tags with name printed from label maker
* Know how each part of the event is supposed to be run
  * i.e know the desired arrangement for set-up, know what stations are needed and where interns should be assigned, etc.
* Delegate specific areas of the event to specific interns/advocates
* Fill in for interns/advocates that need a pee break/run and get equipment/etc.
* Not leaving the event for extended periods of time
* Connecting directly with Advisor for troubleshooting and creating quick fixes if something isnâ€™t right
* Keeping the event customer friendly

_**Advocate**_

* Advocates are volunteers that want to get involved in meaningful work through H&W. Especially as we are getting to know them, they should be shadowing an intern or working directly with an intern or Advisor on projects
* Assume they know nothing about our program.
* They should be mentored, nurtured, appreciated.
* They should rarely be sent to do tasks by themselves, but should be paired with interns who are well trained.
* Advocates should only be assigned meaningful tasks \(no chores\)
