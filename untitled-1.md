Dear everyone,

There have been a few events with refrigerated food that had a lot of left overs. These items are in the refrigerator and there is not room for the food. I'm also concerned that the food will go bad if a plan for its use is not arranged ASAP. If you had an event with left over refrigerated food that is still in the kitchen, please make a plan for that food and communicate the plan to our whole team.

Moving forward, I want to be sure that we have a plan for managing any refrigerated food that is left over from an event. I need the adviser for an event that has refrigerated food, to be responsible for making a plan for the leftover food. This should be done immediately after the event \(as part of event clean up\), and the plan should be communicated to the whole team so we all know: what, when, where, and how the food will be used or disposed of \(if it's not good anymore\). You may need to check in with each other to see if the food can be used at another event in the same week. BUT the responsibility is on the adviser who ordered the food, not on anyone else until another staff person says "I want it for my event, I am now the person taking on responsibility for this food." If no one wants it within a reasonable time period, it's yours to handle and arrange for the food use or disposal.

Thank you!
