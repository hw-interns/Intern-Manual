# H&W Pro Staff & Intern Communication Protocol

Guiding Principles:

* Working together in a team of 8 staff and 29 interns is hard.
* As we get to know each other we need to pause, slow down, listen, & clarify
* Minimize assuming, jumping to conclusions, cutting each other off. 

1. **WEEKLY:**
   1. ALL Intern MEETING: This is an important opportunity to give and receive information. Please pay attention and come prepared with info that all interns/staff need to know.
   2. MONDAY EMAIL: currently added to bottom of Maka Monday Email
      1. Read thoroughly. Reply if requested
2. **DAILY:**
   1. EMAIL:  We ask that pro-staff and interns use email for detailed announcements or issues between meetings.  Reply to work related emails within 24 hours during the work week \(8-5, M-F, Interns should not check email over the weekend.\) All time spent on email should be recorded on Kronos as time worked. It is recommended for interns to work in 30 minute \(min\) blocks of time when possible. However, time can be recorded in 15 minute increments.
      1. Most appropriate for action items, collaborative work, items that need more conversation
      2. Example “What is the protocol for communication?” or “We need to figure out a system for key distribution”
      3. Subject line helpers:
         1. FYI \(For Your Information\)
         2. Time Sensitive
         3. Action Required
         4. Please Respond or Please Reply or Please Reply ALL
3. **IMMEDIATE:**
   1. GROUP ME: Use group me for urgent issues that **apply to most/all of the group**. If you cannot help, like the message to confirm receipt. If you can help, respond so everyone can see that issue has been taken care of.
      1. Example 1: “Everyone needs to wear their H&W shirts to meeting tomorrow.”
      2. Example 2: “Jo is sick today. Can someone cover her shift from 2-3pm?”
   2. TEXT as needed for issues that are:
      1. Specific
      2. time sensitive
      3. apply to a small group
         1. Example: “Jo, where is the bell we use for meditation”
   3. PHONE CALL may work better for:
      1. Specific
      2. time sensitive
      3. apply to one person
         1. Example: “Hi Jo, no one is here to relieve me and I have to go to class.”
4. **TEAM COMMUNICATION:** Each team may devise additional communication protocols. Team protocols should be determined in a way that prioritizes
   1. using team meetings to cover most issues
   2. respects intern & pro-staff time
   3. balance work/life responsibilities
