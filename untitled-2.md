# Health and Wellness Policy Sheet

Suggested:

-Wearing/Representing H&W negatively \(What is negative? Breaking ethics and behavioral norms in your shirt/sweatshirt? Would trash talking the program be considered ‘negative representation?\)

-Sexual conduct between intern/leader \(What defines sexual conduct? What if they are seen touching or dancing? Seen kissing? How specific do we need to get?\)
