# Working over Quarter Break Policy \(Interns\)

Intern budget for work hours is based on 10 weeks at 12 hours per week. Interns are not required to work week 10, so the budget should allow for students to work after they have finished finals. Here are the guidelines:

1. Approval to work over break is given on a case by case basis.
2. No one is allowed to work during clinic closure dates.
3. Working over break is not mandatory.
4. Staff compile and prioritize specific projects that need to be done over break.
5. Interns should estimate how many hours they plan to work-final approval by Sharleen.
6. All work must be completed in the office and staff must be present to supervise.
