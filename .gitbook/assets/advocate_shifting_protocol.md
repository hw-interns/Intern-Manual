events:

1.  On Wednesdays after 9:30pm look through events for the next two
    weeks (more than 2 weeks will not be up to date)

    a.  check to see if Advocates are needed by looking at the
        description section.

2\. Click on the event you're interested in and make sure you can attend
it marking on your own calendar

3\. Email [*hw.interns@sa.ucsb.edu*](mailto:hw.interns@ucsb.edu) the

For Goo Cal:

Advocates:

Please confirm your shift by accepting the Google Calendar Invitation
(you will be invited to the entire event, even though your shift might
be shorter…see description embedded in the google invitation)

If you sign up for a shift, please make every effort to follow thru on
your commitment. We depend on Advocates.

If you have to cancel **more than 48 hours in advance**: please email
<hw.interns@sa.ucsb.edu> and let them know what event/program you signed
up for.

If you have to cancel **LESS than 48 hours in advance**: please text the
Pro Staff AND intern listed on the Google Calendar Invitation.

Failure to follow thru on volunteer shifts may result in restriction
from future H&W opportunities.

***ADVOCATE CONTACT PROTOCOL ??? I think Goo Cal reminders should be
enough. Let’s try and see. If it doesn’t work, we can implement this
protocol. ***

Here are some rules/guidelines/etiquettes for contacting Advocates.

1.  CHAIR? SHIFT LEADER? is responsible for texting advocate(s) 24 hours
    in advance of the start of the event

2.  Text the advocate(s) that are on the same shift as you.

3.  Contact them by text if possible, if not then use email.

    -   Sample TEXT: Hi Julian! This is Joanna from Health & Wellness.
        Reminder: You have signed up for \[Name of Event\] from 0:00am
        to 0:00pm @ \[location\]. If needed, follow up with where to
        find the H&W table.

4.  Be friendly . You are possibly the first person they are meeting in
    H&W other than the Advocate Coordinators.

5.  Finally, if an advocate does not show up please EMAIL Advocate
    Coordinators by the end of the same day. Follow up is very important
    for accountability.

***ADVOCATE NO SHOW PROTOCOL ***

1.  If Advocates are shifted for your event and they do not show, email
    Advocate Coords the same day and include name of advocate and name
    of event with the subject line: Advocate NO Show

2.  Advocate Coords will TEXT? EMAIL? the advocate to make sure they are
    ok and let them know they were missed.

3.  If Advocates cancel or no show once, they get a nice TEXT? EMAIL?
    explaining that we need them

4.  Second time they get a warning by TEXT? EMAIL?

5.  Third time they get a nice TEXT? EMAIL? saying that we are sorry but
    we cannot shift them for X amount of time, but we hope they are more
    open in the future (something like that).
